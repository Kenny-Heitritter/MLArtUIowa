List of Things to Do:
-Implement MNIST classifer using Pytorch. This will be a nice stepping stone to using Pytorch with our data as the dataset is effectively the same.
-Play around with Pytorch NN architectures (GPU) using our processed data. Determine an architecture that, hopefully, performs better than the simple multilayer perceptron used in the SimpleNN analysis.
